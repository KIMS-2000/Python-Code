    " The problem solvers have found a new Island for coding and named it as Philaland.These smart people were given a task to make purchase of items at the Island easier by distributing various coins with different value.Manish has come up with a solution that if we make coins category starting from $1 till the maximum price of item present on Island, then we can purchase any item easily. He added following example to prove his point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Letâ€™s suppose the maximum price of an item is 5$ then we can make coins of {$1, $2, $3, $4, $5}to purchase any item ranging from $1 till $5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now Manisha, being a keen observer suggested that we could actually minimize the number of coins required and gave following distribution {$1, $2, $3}. According to him any item can be purchased one time ranging from $1 to $5. Everyone was impressed with both of them.Your task is to help Manisha come up with minimum number of denominations for any arbitrary max price in Philaland."
