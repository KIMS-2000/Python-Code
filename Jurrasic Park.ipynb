    "Smilodon is a ferocious animal which used to live during the Pleistocene epoch (2.5 mya–10,000 years ago). Scientists successfully created few smilodons in an experimental DNA research. A park is established and those smilodons are kept in a cage for visitors.\n",
    "This park consists of Grasslands(G), Mountains(M) and Waterbodies(W) and it has three gates (situated in grasslands only). Below is a sample layout.\n",
    "Before opening the park, club authority decides to calculate Safety index of the park. The procedure of the calculation is described below. Please help them to calculate.\n",
    "Safety Index calculation\n",
    "Assume a person stands on grassland(x) and a Smilodon escapes from the cage situated on grassland(y). If the person can escape from any of those three gates before the Smilodon able to catch him, then the grassland(x) is called safe else it is unsafe. A person and a Smilodon both take 1 second to move from one area to another adjacent area(top, bottom, left or right) but a person can move only over grasslands though Smilodon can move over grasslands and mountains.\n",
    "If any grassland is unreachable for Smilodon(maybe it is unreachable for any person also), to increase safe index value Club Authority use to mark those grasslands as safe land. Explained below\n",
    "For the above layout, there is only one gate at (4,6)\n",
